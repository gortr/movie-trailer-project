## Project Info
**Filename:** README.md
**Main Project File:** movie_trailer_project.py
**Connected Module Files:** movie_media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py

## Configuration Instructions
```sh
movie_trailer_project.py
```

This is the primary file for running the movie website for browsing the movie selection and previewing trailers.

This file connects the other components from movie_media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py together which builds the overall site.

### Operating Instructions
If you want to run the script you must be using some type of IDE that can run Python scripts as it is an interpreted language.

For example, if you are using the standard Python IDLE  (GUI) then you would open the file in that environment. 

You would need to,

* Open Python IDLE (GUI)
* Click on "File" at the top left of the window
* Select "Open" and browse to the file "movie_trailer_project.py"
* Once the file is open you will then click on "Run" at the top of the new window.
* Select "Run Module"
* The script will then run and open a web browser, depending on your default preferred webbrowser on your system, and display the site for browsing.
